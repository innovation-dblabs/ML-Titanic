# Machine Learning using the Titanic data
ML analysis using python on the open source Titanic survivor dataset.

We start out with basic Data Exploration, followed by some Data Cleanup which is needed before we train Logic Regression Model for Prediction.

There are 2 files ( slightly different)
- titianic.ipynb this is a Jupyter notebook
- titanic-st.py  this is a streamlit version of the code


### Pre-requisites:
- Python 3.6 Anaconda since it has most of the packages and Jupyter Notebook (https://www.anaconda.com/)
- Streamlit for the web version of the analysis ( https://streamlit.io/ )

Thanks to Kaggle, Wikipedia for the some of the materials.
