# ML-Tititanic
ML analysis using python on the open source Titanic dataset.

We start out with basic Data Exploration, followed by some data cleanup which is needed before we run a Logic Regression Model for Prediction.

There are 2 files ( slightly different)
- titianic.ipynb this is a pythio notebook
- titanic-st.py  this is a streamlit version of the code


Thanks to Kaggle, Wikipedia for the materials.
